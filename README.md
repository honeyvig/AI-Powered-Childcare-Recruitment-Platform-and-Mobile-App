    Seamless Communication:
        Built-in messaging, scheduling, and video call capabilities for employers and job seekers to communicate easily.
        Notifications and reminders for interviews, follow-ups, and task management.

    Employer Branding Tools:
        Employers can showcase their company culture through features like:
            Virtual Office Tours (360-degree photos or video)
            Testimonials: Former employees or other candidates can leave feedback and reviews.
            Company Overview Pages: Display mission, vision, and values.

    Data-Driven Insights:
        Employers will receive data analytics on market trends, hiring performance, skill gaps in the childcare sector, and salary insights.
        Job seekers can also access career insights to improve their resumes and job search strategies.

    Additional Features:
        Multilingual Support: Enable users from various regions to interact with the platform in their preferred language.
        Gamification: Implement badges, career progression roadmaps, and incentives to encourage engagement.
        Video Resumes: Job seekers can upload personalized video resumes to stand out to potential employers.
        Virtual Job Fairs: Host live virtual events where employers can interact with job seekers, conduct interviews, and share job listings.

Technical Requirements

    Backend Infrastructure:
        Database: Use a relational database (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL) for storing user profiles, job postings, and communication data.
        Cloud Hosting: Host the platform on AWS or Google Cloud for scalability and reliability. Utilize services like Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and S3 for storage.
        AI Engine: Integrate AI models for resume parsing, job description generation, and smart matching. Utilize platforms like OpenAI for natural language processing (NLP) and TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning.
        API Integration: Integrate with third-party APIs for job scraping, payment gateways (e.g., Stripe), and communication tools (e.g., Twilio for messaging and Zoom API for video interviews).
        Search Engine: Use Elasticsearch or Algolia for fast and efficient searching of job listings and candidate profiles.

    Frontend & Mobile App:
        Frontend Framework: ReactJS for the web platform, ensuring responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
        Mobile App: Develop native apps using React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).
